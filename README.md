**Competitive Congressional District Map**

A React component with interactive congressional districts built on top of Google Maps Javascript API using FullstackReact's ["google-maps-react"](https://github.com/fullstackreact/google-maps-react) package. The Google Fusion Table Layer provided by Sharon Machlis, using Cartographic Boundary KML Files to denote district boundaries taken from the [United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/kml/kml_cds.html) for the 115th Congress. Fusion Table Layer functionality based on Tom Chen's ["react-google-maps"](https://github.com/tomchentw/react-google-maps) package.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
